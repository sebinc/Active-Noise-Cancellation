INFO:Timing:2698 - No timing constraints found, doing default enumeration.
INFO:Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).
INFO:Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths 
   option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the 
   unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on 
   a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, 
   and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, 
   please see the device datasheet.
INFO:Timing:3390 - This architecture does not support a default System Jitter 
   value, please add SYSTEM_JITTER constraint to the UCF to modify the Clock 
   Uncertainty calculation.
INFO:Timing:3389 - This architecture does not support 'Discrete Jitter' and 
   'Phase Error' calculations, these terms will be zero in the Clock 
   Uncertainty calculation.  Please make appropriate modification to 
   SYSTEM_JITTER to account for the unsupported Discrete Jitter and Phase 
   Error.
